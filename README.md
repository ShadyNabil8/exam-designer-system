# Exam Question Generator Created for Intlaq Backend Engineer Role

This project is a backend system for generating exams based on teacher-defined constraints using genetic algorithms. It allows teachers to specify the number of questions from each chapter, difficulty levels, and educational objectives, and it uses genetic algorithm to optimize a set of questions that meet those constraints.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize question selection based on various criteria (chapter, difficulty, and objective).
- **Question Management**: Add and retrieve questions by chapters, difficulty, and objectives.
- **Exam Generation**: Generates an optimal set of questions for the exam.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger integrated for easy API testing and documentation.
- **Unit Testing**: Jest integrated for easy API testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing questions, chapters, and exams.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Optimizes the selection of questions.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and testing interface.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **React.js**: For frontend.
